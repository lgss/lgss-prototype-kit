  <p>
    The government standard for identity verification is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/introducing-govuk-verify/introducing-govuk-verify">GOV.UK Verify</a>. Using GOV.UK Verify, the user can securely prove their identity. The service can also recieve the user's address {{"and date of birth" if age}} from GOV.UK Verify.
  </p>
  <p>
    Councils should also offer alternative routes to access the service if a user chooses not to use GOV.UK Verify. This should include an online and offline alternatives. See sub-section c, below, for more detail on alternatives.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="/service-patterns/{{ serviceString }}/example-service/prove-identity">See the example council page for telling users about proving their identity</a>

    <h3 class="heading-small">"Unlikely to verify" and "verification failed" pages</h3>

    <p>Some users may not have the documents or credit records that GOV.UK Verify needs to prove their identity.</p>

    <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>
        GOV.UK Verify asks users questions to work out if they are likely to be verified. If it looks like they won't be verified, they are shown the "<a href="https://pirate:bunting@govuk-verify.herokuapp.com/unlikely-to-verify?requestId={{serviceString}}-{{council.string}}&selection=true&above_age_threshold=false&resident_last_12_months=false&not_resident_reason=NoAddress">unlikely to verify</a>" page.
      </li>
      <li>
        A very small proportion of users will go through past these questions, and GOV.UK Verify will still not be able to verify their identity. These users will be told by their chosen Identity Provider that they couldn't be verified, and then be taken back to GOV.UK, where they will see a similar "<a href="https://pirate:bunting@govuk-verify.herokuapp.com/fail?requestId={{serviceString}}-{{council.string}}&serviceLOA=2&verify=false&security1=&security2=&firstName=&middleName=&lastName=&prevFirstName=&prevMiddleName=&prevLastName=&dob-day=&dob-month=&dob-year=&idp=experian&userLOA=2"> verification failed</a>" page. (<a href="https://pirate:bunting@govuk-verify.herokuapp.com/intro?requestId=apply-for-parking-permit-{{council.string}}&verify=false">Step through the example GOV.UK Verify journey as a user who can not be verified</a>.)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Both these pages should link to the alternative ways to access the service described in sub-section c below.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="/service-patterns/{{ serviceString }}/example-service/start-non-verify">See the example council page the user should see if GOV.UK Verify fails to verify them</a>
    </p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 class="heading-small">Alternative ways to access the service</h3>

    <p>
      Alternative ways to access the service need to be shown to the user on the "<a href="/service-patterns/{{ serviceString }}/example-service/prove-identity">proving identity</a>" page, the "<a href="https://pirate:bunting@govuk-verify.herokuapp.com/unlikely-to-verify?requestId={{serviceString}}-{{council.string}}&selection=true&above_age_threshold=false&resident_last_12_months=false&not_resident_reason=NoAddress">unlikely to verify</a>" page, and the "<a href="https://pirate:bunting@govuk-verify.herokuapp.com/fail?requestId={{serviceString}}-{{council.string}}&serviceLOA=2&verify=false&security1=&security2=&firstName=&middleName=&lastName=&prevFirstName=&prevMiddleName=&prevLastName=&dob-day=&dob-month=&dob-year=&idp=experian&userLOA=2"> verification failed</a>" page.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the alternative online route, users will need to prove their address {{"and age" if age}} by scanning in documents. This will require manual checks by councils.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="/service-patterns/{{ serviceString }}/example-service/add-poa">See the example council page for asking a user to scan in documents to prove their address</a>
    </p>
    {% set addressLink = '<p><a href="/service-patterns/' + serviceString + '/example-service/add-poage">See the example council page for asking a user to scan in documents to prove their age</a></p>' %}
    {{ addressLink | safe if age }}
    <p>
      Alternative routes should also include the offline ways of accessing the service mentioned on the service start page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Councils will provide details to GDS of the above alternative ways to access the service when integrating with GOV.UK Verify.
