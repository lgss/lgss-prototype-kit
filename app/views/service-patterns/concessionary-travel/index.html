                    This page is for people who work in local authorities. It outlines a common pattern used for delivering older person's concessionary travel services effectively.

                    This pattern is specific to England. Concessionary travel passes work differently in

                            Users need to find out about their entitlement to concessionary travel. They may find out in a variety of ways, for example:

                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Local authorities should try to make sure the right information is being provided through these channels.

                        <p>
                            Residents in England can get a bus pass for free travel when they reach the female State Pension age, whether they’re a man or a woman.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Residents of London can travel free on buses, tubes and other transport when they’re 60 or older, but only within London.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This means that users may need to check whether or not they are old enough for concessionary travel.
                            <a href="https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-age/y/bus_pass">There's a page for this on GOV.UK.</a>
                            Councils should link to this page on their service start page. (See step 3.)
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3 class="heading-small">Find the right council</h3>

                        <p>
                            Once the user has found out they can get a free travel pass, they need to get to the right council's website to apply. Users might start by typing 'older person bus pass' or a related term into a search engine, or they might start on their local
                            council's website.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-for-elderly-person-bus-pass">The older person's bus pass page on GOV.UK</a>
                            should send them to the right council's website once they enter their postcode. Councils should make sure the postcodes that they serve are linked to the right page on their website and email any corrections to
                            <a href="mailto:local-direct-admin@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">local-direct-admin@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Users may also go straight to the website for the council that they think they need to get a travel pass from. This makes it very important that councils clearly state which area their concessionary travel service serves as the user may be in the
                            wrong place. Read the next section for details on this.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Now the user is in the right place, the page on the council's website should communicate:
                        </p>

                                what the pass will allow its holder to do
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                when the user is allowed to travel using the pass (The national bus concession in England is available at any time on a Saturday, Sunday or bank holiday, and from 9.30am to 11pm on any other day although some authorities offer extended travel times.)

                      <p>
                        The council should show the user their date of birth for the user to confirm it. (This is mainly done because of a legal requirement to show user's the data that has been received from GOV.UK Verify.)

                      <p>
                        If the user's date of birth is not correct, something has probably gone wrong in the verifying process, so the user should be advised to continue using a different channel.

                        If the user confirms their date of birth, the council should check the user is old enough to be eligible. If the user is not eligible based on their date of birth councils should tell them and also tell the user when they will be eligible.

                        <p>
                            GOV.UK Verify will send the council the user's address, as known by the user's chosen identity provider. On returning from the GOV.UK Verify process, the council should ask the user to confirm whether or not this is their current address. (This is mainly done because GOV.UK Verify identity providers may not have the user's address if they moved house in the last 3 months.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          This page can also ask the user to confirm they want the council to send the bus pass to the address they've received through GOV.UK Verify.

                            If the user says the address returned is not correct, they are likely to be a new resident whose address has not been updated with their identity provider. The user should then be asked to enter their current address and warned that they must not
                            enter false information as this is a civic offence. If the travel pass is physical, councils will get extra confidence in the address by mailing the pass to the address given. Councils should mention they will be using the address for this purpose on
                            the confirmation page.

                        At this point the council should check whether or not they have a bus pass against their records. If they already have a pass, they should tell them they are not eligible to apply for a new one, but they can renew or replace a lost or stolen one with the 'Renew or replace your bus pass' service. The page should also include a link to contact the council if the user believes there has been a mistake.</p>

                            Bus passes need to have a photograph of the person who owns them, so that they can't be used by anybody else. It's a bus driver's responsibility to check the photo matches the user.

                            Users can upload a digital photograph of themselves for use on the bus pass. Uploading a photo can be a complicated task for users depending on their circumstances, so the council service should find the right route for them with a series of questions, illustrated in this flow chart:

                        {% include 'includes/upload-photo-flow.svg' %}

                        <p>
                            Once the user has uploaded their photograph, the council should tell the user their application is complete and reiterate when they can expect to receive their bus pass and that they will be posting it to the address they previously confirmed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The accompanying letter should also provide information on how, when and where the bus pass can be used, and what to do in case of a lost or stolen pass.

                        <p>
                          Many users want to be informed of the progress of their application. To notify users of their progress, you'll need to ask them for their preferred contact method and details.

                            Bus passes are a physical plastic card that users can use on any bus in England. They either have to show it to the driver or scan on a reader when they get onto the bus.

                        <p>
                            In London, the pass is an Oyster card which the user scans on a reader.

                        <p>
                            To reduce the possibility of fraud, bus passes have expiry dates which must be no more than 5 years from the date of issue. (Specification 1.31 from the

                            Councils should send a notification to the user's preferred channel when their bus pass is about to expire.
