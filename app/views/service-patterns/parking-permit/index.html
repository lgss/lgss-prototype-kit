                    This page is for people who work in local authorities. It outlines a common pattern used for delivering resident's parking permits services effectively.

                <h2 class="heading-medium" id="user-need">What is the user need?</h2>
                <p>
                    Residents need a place to park their car near their home. Parking permit services make sure that parking spaces are only occupied by residents by making it illegal to park in a given area without a permit.
                </p>
                <p>We recommend that local authorities provide the parking permit service using a user centric approach.</p>

                <h2 class="heading-medium" id="council-need">What do councils need from users to deliver the service?</h2>
                <p>Depending on local authority needs, the user may be asked to provide a combination of:</p>
                <ul class="list list-bullet">
                  <li>
                    the postcode of the area where the user wants to park
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      proof that the user lives in the area
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      the registration number of the vehicle to be permitted (some councils)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      payment (this is to support the cost of the service and will vary across councils and potentially within service, depending on the type of vehicle, engine size, parking zone and others)
                  </li>
                </ul>

                    At a high level, these are the steps users should need to go through.

                        <p>
                            Users need to find out about the parking permits service before they need to park their car. There are a number of ways users could find out about the service, for example:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="list list-bullet">
                            <li>
                                information from the council when they sign up for council tax
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                information from their estate agent when they buy their house
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                signage in the street
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Local authorities should make sure the correct information is being provided through all channels within their control.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3 class="heading-small">Finding the right council</h3>
                        <p>
                            Once the user has found out they need a permit, they need to get to the right council's website to apply. Users might start by typing 'parking permit' into a search engine, or they might start on the council's website where they think they need a
                            permit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <a href="https://www.gov.uk/parking-permit">The parking permits page on GOV.UK</a>
                            should send them to the right council's website once they enter their postcode. Councils should make sure the postcodes that they serve are linked to the right page on their website and email any corrections to
                            <a href="mailto:local-direct-admin@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">local-direct-admin@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Users may also go straight to the website for the council that they think they need to get a permit from. This makes it very important that councils clearly state which area their parking permit service covers as the user may be in the wrong place.
                            Read the next section for details on this.

                      <p>
                        Some users may not go through the first two steps above, and arrive on the council's website with a need to park, but no knowledge that they need a permit. For this reason, it's important that the council explains they may need a permit.
                      </p>
                      <p>

                      <h3 class="heading-small">Routing to the right boundary</h3>
                      <p>
                        The council needs to find out where the user wants to park so they can:
                      </p>
                      <ul class="list list-bullet">
                        <li>
                          give the permit for the right parking boundary to the user
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          let the user know if there are no permits available for the area in which they want to park
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          ask the user if they are a resident in the parking boundary
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>
                        This should be done at this early point in the user journey so that the user doesn't have to go through unnecessary effort.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <a href="parking-permit/example-service/check-boundary">See the example service page for asking users where they want to park</a>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        At this point the council should also check if there are permits available in the area the user wants to park in. If permits are available, move the user onto the next step. If not, the council should tell the user what the nearest boundaries with permits available are.
                      </p>

                    <li>
                      <h3 class="heading-small">Picking the right permit type</h3>
                      <p>
                        Once the council knows where the user wants to park, they can tell the user about the parking boundary and ask if they are a resident of that area.
                      </p>

                            GOV.UK Verify will send the council the user's address, as known by the user's chosen identity provider. On returning from the GOV.UK Verify process, the council should ask the user to confirm whether or not this is their current address.

                            If the user says the address returned is not correct, they are likely to be a new resident whose address has not been updated with their identity provider. The user should then be asked to enter their current address and warned that they must not

                            If the permit is physical, councils will get extra confidence in the address by mailing the permit to the address given. Councils should mention they'll be using the address for this purpose on the confirmation page.

                            If the permit is digital and councils want extra confidence of eligibility, they can issue a temporary permit for a shorter time period, for example 3 months. After this time, the user's identity provider should have the new address and the user can
                            reapply.

                                    Some councils have limits on the number of people who can get a permit, or number of permits allowed per address. At the same time as check addresss eligibility (from the point of view of the user), the council should check whether or not there are
                                    any permits currently assigned to the person or their address and issue an ineligible message if applicable.

                                    If the user is eligible for multiple permits, for example visitors permits, the council should ask which type of permit the user would like to apply for.

                          Some councils require the permit to be associated with a specific vehicle.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          If the council requires this for enforcement purposes, the council should specify that this is why they need this information.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In some councils, the permit price varies depending on the vehicle type, emissions, make or other conditions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          If the council requires this information, they can look it up using DVLA's vehicle details API. In this case, the page should explain to users that their registration number will be used for this purpose as well.

                        This page should only be displayed if the user actually has a choice of permit at this stage. Generally councils give users a choice of 6 month or 12 month permits.

                      <p>
                        If the council has used the DVLA vehicle details API, they should display the returned data to the user and explain that the vehicle price has been calculated based on that info.

                            The fee will vary based on the fee calculation rules determined by each individual council. In some cases the permit can be issued free of charge, for example, if the resident is the first member of the household to apply.

                        <p>
                            After payment, the user needs to receive a confirmation of payment and an acknowledgement that their application has been successful. They should also receive information about how the permit will be enforced (See step 8). If the payment cannot be
                            accepted or if the application fails for some reason (i.e. times out) the user should be shown an on-screen message that specifies the next steps a user should take to continue with the application.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The service should ask the user how they would like to receive this confirmation of payment, offering the choice of email, letter or text.

                            You may want to capture users contact details so they can be contacted if things go wrong with their application, or for use in future for renewal reminders.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You should allow users to select their prefered contact method and only contact them in this way in future.

                            It's better for users and cheaper for government if the permits are issued electronically. Wardens check the permits by entering number plates into a database.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Councils who haven't yet moved over to an electronic permit system, should have a plan in place to move over.
                        </p>

                        <p>In the meantime, councils should mention in the payment receipt

                            <li>this information should also be communicated on the council's start page at the beginning of the user journey</li>

                        <p>
                            Temporary permits should clearly show their expiry date so wardens and users can check them easily.

                            Councils should remind users when it's time for them to renew their permits. They should do this using the same contact method as used in the payment receipt.
